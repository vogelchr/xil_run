xil_run -- Run XILINX ISE utilities within their strange environment.

Written December 2015 by Christian Vogel <vogelchr@vogel.cx>, placed
in the public domain, I don't claim any rights to this short piece of
scripting code.

The XILINX development environment needs a shitload of environment
variables to set up. This is done by their "settings64.sh" shell-script.
As I don't want to pollute my stanadard environment with all this junk,
I've written this wrapper that can be used to effortlessly run the Xilinx
utilities.  Unfortunately, the "settings64.sh" script is a little peculiar
in the way it likes to be called, hence this wrapper is a little convoluted :-).

The utility assumes the Xilinx toolchain to be installed as a subdirectory
of /opt/Xilinx, for example /opt/Xilinx/14.7.

Installation:

	$ sudo install -m755 xil_run /usr/local/bin
	$ sudo ln -sf xil_run /usr/local/bin/planAhead

	...perform the last step for very utility you want to
	   call via this wrapper.

Resulting files in /usr/local/bin:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root         7 Dec 14 13:11 planAhead -> xil_run
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root  root      2637 Dec 14 13:07 xil_run

Run, for example, planAhead (via the symlink):

	➜  xil_run  planAhead
	Using XILINX ISE in /opt/Xilinx/14.7.
	Symlink mode, running planAhead.
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/common/.settings64.sh...
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/EDK/.settings64.sh...
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/PlanAhead/.settings64.sh...
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/ISE/.settings64.sh...
	%  <--- PlanAhead Prompt

Or ise, via the xil_run utility:

	➜  xil_run  xil_run ise
	Using XILINX ISE in /opt/Xilinx/14.7.
	Direct mode, running ise.
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/common/.settings64.sh...
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/EDK/.settings64.sh...
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/PlanAhead/.settings64.sh...
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/ISE/.settings64.sh...
	. /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/common/.settings64.sh /opt/Xilinx/14.7/ISE_DS/common
	( ise now open )
